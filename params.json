{"name":"Muicraft Launcher","tagline":"The custom launcher for Muicraft server","body":"Muicraft Launcher\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis project provides an open-source Minecraft launcher platform for downloading,\r\ninstalling, and updating modpacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis launcher is maintained by Heracles421, and is a forge from sk89q's project, who writes WorldEdit, WorldGuard, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt has been primarily developed for [Muicraft server] (http://www.muicraft.net), but you can use it for your own modpack or\r\nserver.\r\n\r\n* One of Minecraft's oldest launchers -- since Minecraft Alpha\r\n* Requires almost no configuration files to make a modpack\r\n* Add a new mod by dropping in the .jar (and its configuration)\r\n* Remove a mod by deleting its .jar (and configuration).\r\n* Builds **server** modpacks with no extra configuration\r\n* Advanced download system: incremental, file removal detection, optional feature/mod selection, etc.\r\n* Very easy for users to use and install modpacks\r\n* Pretty well-documented with easy-to-understand, well-organized code*\r\n* Open source!\r\n\r\n*Except for the Launcher frame class. That one is pretty bad.\r\n\r\n### Previous Versions\r\n\r\nThis repository only contains code for the launcher versions 4.x and newer.\r\n\r\nYou can find [the 3.x version on GitHub](https://github.com/sk89q/skmclauncher).\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nFirst off, be aware that the launcher in this directory has been branded for Muicraft server, so you will have to replace that with your own. There's only a few places that you need to do that, and it's all documented on sk89q's documentation page.\r\n\r\n**You can fork the project on GitHub** and make modifications.\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/Launcher)\r\n\r\nNote that documentation may be lacking in some places. If you run into problems,\r\n**do not hesitate to ask**.\r\n\r\nCompiling\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe launcher can be compiled using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).\r\n\r\n    mvn clean package\r\n\r\nIf you wish to import the project into an IDE, you must add support for\r\nProject Lombok.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPull requests can be submitted on GitHub, but we will accept them\r\nat our discretion. Please note that your code must follow\r\nOracle's Java Code Conventions.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe launcher is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
